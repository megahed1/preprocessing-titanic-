# Data Preprocessing for [Titanic]
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and preprocessing the [Titanic] dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle. The aim of this project was to clean, prepare, and optimize the data for further analysis or modeling.

Dataset Information

    Source: Kaggle - Dataset Link
    Dataset Description:
    Briefly describe the dataset (e.g., The dataset contains sales records for products in different regions, customer demographics, etc.).
    Number of rows and columns.
    File format: .csv, .xlsx, etc.

Tools & Libraries Used

    collab for interactive exploration
    Kaggle for data sourcing

After preprocessing, the dataset was cleaned, normalized, and ready for further analysis.

      Missing values handled and outliers removed.
      Histograms: Showed improved distribution for key numerical features.
      Box Plots: Demonstrated removal of extreme outliers.
      Correlation Heatmap: Showed cleaner relationships between features.
